- Generates **personalized recipes** (breakfast/lunch/dinner/snack) based on:
    - User‚Äôs health goals, macro targets, allergies, dietary restrictions, and ingredient preferences.
    - Evidence from nutrition databases and PubMed.
- Returns **clean, valid JSON**: easy for apps or UIs.
- Produces detailed nutrition breakdown and science-backed justification for every recipe.
- Supports **base recipe generation** and subsequent *adjustment* for macro or ingredient tweaks.
